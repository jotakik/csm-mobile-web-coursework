                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, I am Joshua. My studies are primarily in Computer Science,
                    and I am continuing to enhance my CS knowledge through classes at
                    the College of San Mateo. In my spare time, I rock climb (both
                    bouldering and top rope), garden, and do house repairs.
                    A quote that inspires me is one that I heard in the Hobbit films, when
                    the dwarf Balin describes his loyalty to the leader, Thorin. He explains
                    to Bilbo that after seeing Thorin rise up and fight when all seemed lost,
                    he thought to himself: "There is one I could follow, one I could call King."
                    I hope to find people like that in my life, and be someone like that to others.

            <h2>Course motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Last semester, I took courses on JavaScript/AJAX, Swift/iOS programming,
                and Databases at CSM. This semester, I am taking the Mobile Web App
                Development course because I see that increasingly, smartphones are the
                tool of choice that consumers use to interface with the internet and
                software services. Additionally, as more and more software become
                cloud-based and are released as services rather than products, web
                applications have been growing in popularity. Mobile web app development
                brings these trends together.

                    be used at a higher level.
